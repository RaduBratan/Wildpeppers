## Details
Wildpeppers is a project I made for fun between 2019 and 2020 to experiment with Gooogle Firebase. The project is divided into two sections, Wildpeppers Android and Wildpeppers Web. Wildpeppers Android is the Android app front-end that enables users to download wallpapers for their phones from a Firebase database. Wildpeppers Web is the web frontend that enables the admin to manage the entirety of the database without having to open the official Firebase Console.

## Origin
It originates from [probelalkhan/wallpaper-app-android](https://github.com/probelalkhan/wallpaper-app-android) and [probelalkhan/wallpaper-app-admin](https://github.com/probelalkhan/wallpaper-app-admin).

## Name Meaning
Wildpeppers wallpapers adopts the Lawnchair launcher's naming approach, just like ["Emulair emulator"](github.com/raduBratan/emulair) does, therefore the name is nothing more than a homophone for the kind of software that Wildpeppers is (a wallpapers downloading app).

## Disclaimer
The project is broken. It's not actually available on Google Play ://. Lawnchair is not associated with Wildpeppers.
